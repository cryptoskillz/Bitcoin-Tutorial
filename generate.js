This is a general guide on how to code BTC to accept payments on a website. I am pretty much learning from scratch so
with each branch you will my knowledge grow and the software evolve. I have pretty much gone on sabbatical and moved to Asia 
to really deep dive this tech and  I am not coming back until I have a very deep understanding. 

Treat the branches as a chronological order of  development

master

First code commits using the most basic implementation by integrating into a 3rd party API.

generateaddress

Remove the dependency of the 3rd party API (block.io) and store the details in a database. 



TODO:

Turn it into a REST API
Add the listen script that checks for payments made
Store the keys more securely
Create a WWW which generate bar code etc
Create a back office script that deals with orders etc
Create a sweeping script that sweeps the funds into cold storage
Investigate lighting
Investigate side chains
Investigate RSK

Purpose of this branch

Remove Block.io dependency 
Generate an address 
Store the details in a SQL database, insecure I know we will be upgrading it later

Tools used

http://sqlitebrowser.org/ : Sql browser for mac
https://testnet.blockchain.info/ : blockchain explorer for testnet 
https://www.blockchain.com/explorer :  live blockchain explorer 
https://bitcoin.org/en/download : Bitcoin client used (for testnet)

Notes
	Why on earth do I have to specify the testnet in every method just let me call it once and be done with it.
	I would assume it is wise to check the origin of the request here to stop potential dossing  I will read up on best practices. 
	I have yet to read the best practices to store these in a safe manner (keys)
	I will also look into striking back to FIAT (for funsies)
	I will look into how to generate a bitcoin address
	I will lastly look at using hardware wallets to control this (most likely ledger)
